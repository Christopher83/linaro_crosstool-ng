      The newlib "team" rolls new releases about once a year (december).
      This is quite a long time between releases, in case code was fixed.
      
      Saying 'Y' here will allow you to use the bleeding-edge code from
      the CVS repository. This may or may not fix your issues, may or may
      not build, may or may not crash your machine, may or may not withdraw
      money from your bank account, may or may not date your girlfriend,
      may or may not resurect Elvis... :-)
      
      In a word: use the CVS snapshot at your own risk!

      Install Atmel AVR32 headers for native AVR32 development. Most
      AVR32 MCU devices are supported.
      
      If you do native AVR32 development you want to say 'Y' here.
