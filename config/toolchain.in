    default y
    help
      Use the 'shinny new' sysroot feature of gcc: libraries split between
      prefix/target/sysroot/lib and prefix/target/sysroot/usr/lib
      
      You definitely want to say 'Y' here. Yes you do. I know you do. Say 'Y'.

config PREBUILT_SYSROOT
    bool
    depends on USE_SYSROOT
    prompt "Use a pre-built sysroot"
    help
      A pre-built sysroot contains the headers and libraries that were
      built elsewhere for the target system.  Useful when building
      a compiler that targets an existing distribution like Debian or
      Ubuntu.

config PREBUILT_NAME
    string
    prompt "Pre-built sysroot name"
    depends on PREBUILT_SYSROOT
    help
      Base name of the pre-built sysroot without the URL or extension.

config PREBUILT_BASE_URL
    string
    prompt "Pre-built sysroot base URL"
    depends on PREBUILT_SYSROOT

config SYSROOT_NAME
    string
    prompt "sysroot directory name" if ! BACKEND
    depends on USE_SYSROOT
    default "sysroot"
    help
      Enter the base name of the sysroot directory. Usually, this simply
      is 'sysroot' (the default) or 'sys-root'.
      
      You are free to enter anything here, except for spaces, and '/'
      (see SYSROOT_DIR_PREFIX, below). If you leave this empty, then the
      default 'sysroot' is used.

config SYSROOT_DIR_PREFIX
    string
    prompt "sysroot prefix dir (READ HELP)" if ! BACKEND

      This string will be interpreted as a directory component to be added
      to the sysroot path, just before the actual sysroot directory.
      
      In fact, the sysroot path is constructed as:
        ${CT_PREFIX_DIR}/${CT_TARGET}/${CT_SYSROOT_DIR_PREFIX}/${CT_SYSROOT_NAME}

config STATIC_TOOLCHAIN
    bool

    depends on EXPERIMENTAL
    select WANTS_STATIC_LINK
    help
      Build static host binaries.
      
      If you wish to move the toolchain to another host, and you are not
      confident that this host has the required versions of system libs, then
      you can say 'Y' here, and all the host tools will be linked statically.
      
      The impacted tools are:
        - the cross-binutils (GNU binutils, elf2flt)
        - the cross-compiler (gcc)
        - the cross-debugger (gdb)
      
      The default is 'N', to build dynamicaly-linked host binaries.
      
      NOTE: this has no connection to whether the target libraries will be
      dynamic or static. This only applies to the tools themselves.

config TOOLCHAIN_PKGVERSION
    string
    prompt "Toolchain ID string"
    default ""
    help
      Specify a string that identifies your package. You may wish to include
      a build number or build date. This version string will be included in
      the output of gcc --version, and also in binutils, eglibc, gdb and
      gdbserver.

      If this string is left empty, the actual package version will be:
          "crosstool-NG ${CT_VERSION}"
      Otherwise, it will be:
          "crosstool-NG ${CT_VERSION} - ${CT_TOOLCHAIN_PKGVERSION}"

      This is passed to the configure flag --with-pkgversion.

config TOOLCHAIN_BUGURL
    string
    prompt "Toolchain bug URL"
    default ""
    help
      Specify the URL that users should visit if they wish to report a bug.

comment "Tuple completion and aliasing"

config TARGET_VENDOR
    string
    prompt "Tuple's vendor string"
    default "unknown"
    help
      Vendor part of the target tuple.
      
      A tuple is of the form arch-vendor-kernel-system.
      You can set the second part, vendor, to whatever you see fit.
      Use a single word, or use underscores "_" to separate words.
      Use neither dash nor space, as it breaks things.
      
      Keep the default (unknown) if you don't know better.

config TARGET_ALIAS_SED_EXPR
    string
    prompt "Tuple's sed transform"
    default ""
    help
      Normally, you'd call your toolchain components (especially gcc) by
      prefixing the target tuple followed by a dash and the component name
      (eg. armeb-unknown-linux-uclibc-gcc).
      
      You can enter here a sed expression to be applied to ${CT_TARGET} to
      create an alias for your toolchain.
      
      For example, "s/${CT_TARGET_VENDOR}/foobar/" (without the double quotes)
      will create the armeb-foobar-linux-uclibc alias to the above-mentioned
      toolchain.
      
      You shouldn't need to enter anything here, unless you plan to manually
      call the tools (autotools-based ./configure will use the standard name).

config TARGET_ALIAS
    string
    prompt "Tuple's alias"
    default ""
    help
      Normally, you'd call your toolchain components (especially gcc) by
      prefixing the target tuple followed by a dash and the component name
      (eg. armeb-unknown-linux-uclibc-gcc).
      
      You can enter a shortcut here. This string will be used to create
      symbolic links to the toolchain tools (eg. if you enter "foo-bar" here,
      then gcc for your toolchain will also be available as "foo-bar-gcc" along
      with the original name).
      
      You shouldn't need to enter anything here, unless you plan to manually
      call the tools (autotools-based ./configure will use the standard name).

    help
      If you have your *build system* tools in a weird location, and/or
      they have an unusual prefix, enter it here.
      
      Usually, you should leave that empty!
      
      Eg.:
        If your *build* gcc is /opt/build-tools/bin/weird-gcc then you
        should enter:
            /opt/build-tools/bin/weird-
        
        If your *build* gcc is /opt/build-tools/bin/weird-gcc and

config BUILD_SUFFIX
    string
    prompt "|  Tools suffix (READ HELP!)"
    default ""
    help
      If your *build system* tools have an unusual suffix, enter it
      here.
      
      Usually, you should leave that empty!
      
      Eg.:
        If your 'default' gcc is gcc 4.3.1, but you also have gcc-3.4.2
        installed as gcc-3.4, then you should enter:
            -3.4
      
      It can happen that some of the tools have a suffix, when others
      don't, eg. you can have 'gcc-3.4' and 'ar'. crosstool-NG accounts
      for that by checking the tools without the suffix in case it can
      not find some of the tool.

config BUILD_USE_LSBCC
    bool
    prompt "|  Build using the Linux Standard Base compilers"
    help
      Set to use the LSB C and C++ compiler wrappers lsbcc and
      lsbc++ instead of gcc and g++.

      LSB applications are more portable and should run on any LSB
      compliant Linux based operating system.  Note that building
      against a LSB 3.0 system may require a pre-4.3 version of GCC
      and local patches to the LSB build tree.
